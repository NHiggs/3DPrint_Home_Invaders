### Misc Design Notes
Keen eyed video game purists will notice that I've taken liberties with a pixel here and there to make the characters printable and to allow space for hangers. Models were created in blender are are based on 18.5mm per pixel.

### Notes on Scaling
Full disclosure I had some trouble scaling these in Cura, I think the problem is that Belnder isn't the best at joining parts cleanly, your results may vary. To maintain accuracy scale parts along consistent dimensions. 

TL;DR: scale 10,20,and 30 pt invaders to equal height.
